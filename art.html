        <h1>Speak To Me, Speak For Me</h1>
        <p> Sometimes I wonder, how can this stranger make something so intimate
          to me? She sings of things I have yet to experience, but somehow
          they resonate with me. She reveals parts of me that I did not know existed. 
          She inspires new parts of me; she inspires my desire to also communicate
          and express such intimate feelings and messages.  

          <br><br>

          Her art speaks to me in a way that is distant yet personal, and I appreciate
          her message. I, too, want to speak to those distant from me. Do my feelings
          and thoughts resonate with others? Can we connect through an indescribable
          yet mutual understanding? Can my art speak for me in this way?

          Honestly, my art is usually not that deep. I usually either draw still lives for class assignments
          or just sketch female faces, but I really do want to 
          make greater things. I hope that through Mwellon, I can develop my art into
          something greater.

          There is this connection between the artist and audience. The
          connection is distant yet personal. The artist puts out a piece of themself, 
          and the audience connects it to a piece of themself. It's a transfer 
          of self.
