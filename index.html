        <p>What is Mwellon? Mwellon is my art. Mwellon is an outlet for creation. 
          Mwellon is many things I am not yet aware of, for it is a forever developing
          project. Maybe tomorrow, it will be Pwellon instead of Mwellon!

        </figure>
        <p>I love the arts, music, technology, culture, and creation. My hope
          is that Mwellon can contribute and inspire to the different spheres of art. 
          It sounds vague, and that's because I'm not entirely sure of what I want to do yet!
          I've only just created this site, and I have so many more features I want to implement
          and create. Hopefully, this website will soon be responsive to various devices!
          I have so many plans and goals, and this is just the beginning. <br> <br>

          Stay in touch to watch Mwellon grow! <i class="bi bi-heart"></i>
